Module: Ad Evasion Protocol
1. The Placement in the Flow
This check must occur immediately after the IntersectionObserver identifies a new visible post, but before the system enters the LOCKED_ON_TARGET state.
Current Flow: Scroll -> Detect Post -> Lock -> Analyze -> Write.
New Flow: Scroll -> Detect Post -> [Run Ad Check] -> (If Safe: Lock & Write) OR (If Ad: Unlock & Scroll).
2. Detection Heuristics (The "Tells")
Since LinkedIn obfuscates their code, relying on a single check is risky. You must implement a Multi-Layered Filter. If any of these conditions are true, the post is flagged as an Ad.

Heuristic A: The "Promoted" Label (Primary)
Every ad is legally required to identify itself.
Logic: Scan the sub-header area of the post (usually below the profile name).
Check: Does the text content contain the string "Promoted"?
Safety: To handle UI variations, check both the visible text and the aria-label (screen reader text) of the container.
Heuristic B: The "Suggested" Content
LinkedIn injects posts from people you don't follow, labeled "Suggested for you" or "Because you viewed..."
Logic: Scan the "control menu" (the top header above the user's name).
Check: Does it contain the text "Suggested"?
Decision: While not technically an "Ad," these are cold leads. It is recommended to skip them to focus on your actual network.
Heuristic C: The "Menu" Options (Deep Check)
The three-dot menu (...) on a post contains different options for ads versus humans.
Logic: Check the hidden list items in the DOM for the post's menu without clicking it (if pre-rendered).
Check: Look for the existence of the specific option: "Why am I seeing this ad?"
Result: If this string exists in the post's metadata, it is 100% an ad.
Heuristic D: The "Follow" CTA
Organic posts usually show the user's headline (e.g., "CEO at TechCorp"). Ads often replace the headline or the time-stamp with a "Follow" or "Sign Up" Call-To-Action (CTA) link directly in the header.
Check: specific container in the header that holds the timestamp. If it contains a button element instead of a text timestamp, treat it as suspicious.
3. The "Skip" Logic (Action Protocol)
When a post is flagged as an ad, the system must handle it gracefully to maintain the "Human" illusion. You cannot just jump over it instantly.

Step 1: The Micro-Pause
The bot sees the ad.
Action: Wait for a random duration (e.g., 500ms - 1200ms).
Why? This simulates the human brain processing the image, realizing "Oh, this is an ad," and deciding to move on.
Step 2: The "Disinterested" Scroll
Action: Trigger a scroll event that moves past the ad faster than a normal post read.
Velocity: If normal reading scroll is "Slow," the Ad-Skip scroll should be "Medium-Fast."
Step 3: Log & Forget
Action: Do NOT save this creator to your database.
Log: Write a simple entry to your local logs: [SKIPPED] Type: Ad/Promoted.
Reset: Immediately set the Global State back to SCROLLING.
4. Edge Case Handling (False Positives)
The "Hiring" Post
Sometimes a human posts "I'm Hiring," and LinkedIn automatically adds a generic blue banner.
Logic: Ensure your filter looks for the word "Promoted" specifically. Do not filter based solely on the presence of "blue" colors or "Hiring" keywords, as these are often high-value organic posts you want to comment on.
The "Company Page" Post
Companies post organic content (not paid).
Logic: If the post is from a Company but does not say "Promoted," it is organic.
Decision: Decide in user settings if you want to comment on Company Pages. (Usually, it's better to stick to Personal Profiles for networking, but this is a user preference, not an Ad Evasion rule).
